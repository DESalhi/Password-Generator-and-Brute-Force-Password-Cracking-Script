# Password Generator and Brute-Force Password Cracking Script

This script generates a random password of a specified length and cracks the generated password using a brute-force attack. The generated password, time taken to generate the password, and time taken to crack the password are all printed to the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DESalhi/Password-Generator-and-Brute-Force-Password-Cracking-Script.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

cd password-generator

3. Run the script:

python password_generator.py

## Modifying the Script

The password length and character set used for the brute-force attack can be modified in the script. The desired password length can be set by changing the `password_length` variable and the character set used for the brute-force attack can be changed by modifying the `charset` variable.
